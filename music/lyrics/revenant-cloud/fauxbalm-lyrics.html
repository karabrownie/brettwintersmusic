This is not kindness from a kind of soul<br>
That wanders till she feels at home<br>
Sententious holding on her cliché creeds<br>
Her wily fingers dancing on the ivory<br>
Drink and swallow, think an unknown thing<br>
Writing fables hoping that her phone’ll ring<br>
Another day, another final straw<br>
Her reason wants to slip like someone’s lottery call<br>
No qualm<br>
Fauxbalm away<br>
It’s gonna be okay…<br>
<br>
She pays no mind to all the worldly moans<br>
That shake the house she feels at home<br> 
Knock on her door, no answer guaranteed<br>
Her wily fingers dialing someone further than free<br>
Thinks a month’ll make the pauper king<br>
Citing fables wondering what the future’ll bring<br>
Another day, another kind of draw<br> 
The queen is waiting patiently for someone to call<br>
No qualm<br>
Fauxbalm away<br>
It’s gonna be okay…<br>
<br>
