Another day, another final straw<br>
Who could have guessed that we’d be losing it all<br>
These fallen leaves on this fallen ground<br>
Once again we’ll stir the soul to make sound<br>
<br>
This empty world can turn our wonder to stone<br>
Some empty words can make a substitute tome<br>
Where every book reads like a same old book<br>
And every prophet has a truth we mistook<br>
<br>
In the moments when the candle burns out<br>
Some of the light’ll make a revenant cloud<br>
It’s raining down, it’s raining soft<br>
All of the flawless, in itself in the flawed<br>
<br>
