I tried to find solace in outdated ways<br>
The shine wouldn’t keep unless I chased the rays<br>
And when the sun set, I had strayed far from my home<br>
My home<br>
<br>
The dark, it made faces all look the same<br>
The sky couldn’t tell the chemicals from the rain<br>
I sowed Planet Dearth ‘fore the frost of a deep cold<br>
So cold<br>
<br>
Only<br>
Only from way high<br>
I can see everything<br>
Now I’m feeling the weight again<br>
<br>
I tried not to change in a world full of change<br>
The storm tried to shake the ways I held in the pain<br>
And when the sun came, I had strayed far from my soul<br>
My soul<br>
<br>
Only<br>
Only from way high<br>
I can see everything<br>
Now I’m feeling the weight again<br>
<br>
Sorrows<br>
I’ll bank on tomorrows<br>
Pray to see everything<br>
Now I’m feeling the weight again<br>
<br>
Feeling the weight again<br>
Feeling the weight again<br>
I’ll feel it away again<br>
Feel it away again<br>
I’ll feel it away<br>
Feel it away<br>
Feel it away…<br>
