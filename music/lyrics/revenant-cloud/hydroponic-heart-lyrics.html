Your name<br>
Written on the shelf you rest your head from the day<br>
You’ve fallen into living MIA<br>
<br>
For your pain<br>
Is ancestral on the shoulders of wings<br>
Harkens back to those times<br>
You spent in stasis<br>
ageless wanderment<br>
With your hydroponic heart<br> 
<br>
You can’t say<br>
Whether happy comes in one-size-fits-all shirts<br>
or clichés<br>
The best of what’s to come is all too vague<br>
<br>
For your fate<br>
Is anchored on the shoulders of wings<br>
Harkens back to those times<br>
You spent in stasis<br>
ageless wanderment<br>
With your hydroponic heart<br>
<br>
Your roots are frayed<br>
From decades in the drought and the shade<br>
All the loam on your name<br>
Was waiting for the earth and the rain<br>
And the rain...<br>
<br>
For your prayer<br>
Is answered on the shoulders of wings<br>
Harken back to those times<br>
You spent in stasis<br>
Ageless wanderment<br>
With your hydroponic heart<br>
