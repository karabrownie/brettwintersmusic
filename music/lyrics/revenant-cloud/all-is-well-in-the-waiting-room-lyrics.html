Soothe<br>
All is well in the waiting room<br>
Flume<br>
Once I fell<br>
you cut me loose<br>
Exhume<br>
All my hell<br>
Float up to moon<br>
Soothe<br>
All is well in the waiting room<br>
<br>
Soothe<br>
All is well in the waiting room<br>
Plumes<br>
Time will tell<br>
Know from feel truth<br>
Monsoon<br>
Stormy swell we pull through<br>
Soothe<br>
All is well in the waiting room<br>
<br>
(Soon, love)<br>
(Soon, love)<br>
<br>
(Lay down, lay down, lay down<br>
Lay down, love<br>
for you<br>
lay down, lay down, lay down<br>
lay down, love)<br>
<br>
(I can feel it, too)<br>
(I can feel it, too)<br>
(You can feel)<br>
(I can feel it, too<br>
I can feel it all<br>
You can, too<br>
all for you)<br>
<br>
(Summer comes<br>
Summer comes and you're not here<br>
Summer comes and you're not here<br>
Summer comes and you're not here)<br>
<br>
(Winter's here<br>
Winter's here<br>
Caught a break 'cause I've healed<br>
You could make or break me up<br>
You'll make or break me<br>
Make or break me...,)<br>
