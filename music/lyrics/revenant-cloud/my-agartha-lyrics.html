Fear and misguided gait isn’t all I’ve known<br>
Underneath these fragile bones<br>
The curtain of the maudlin shows<br>
I could have sworn I would never leave me there<br>
<br>
I trek it to the northern pole<br>
Looking for my Agartha<br>
Underneath the cratercombs<br>
It’s cutting through the swell of Mother Earth’s hum<br>
<br>
Somewhere in the books<br>
Your words were crawling out<br>
Touching me with all I’m shown<br>
Underneath the layers of snow<br>
A garden of the great all-known<br>
Can some of me find you?<br>
Can some of me meet you there?<br>
<br>
I trek it to the northern pole<br>
Looking for my Agartha<br>
Underneath the cratercombs<br>
It’s cutting through the swell of Mother Earth’s hum<br>
<br>
We're too far gone...<br> 
or are we phasing?<br>
Step stones that fall<br>
under weight of resolve...<br>
Soon, I’ll show self the self I know.<br>
<br>
I trek it to the northern pole<br>
Looking for my Agartha<br>
Underneath the cratercombs<br>
It’s cutting through the swell of Mother Earth’s hum<br>
<br>
I trek it to the great all-known<br>
Looking for my Agartha<br>
Underneath the parts I’ve sown<br>
I'm synching to the swell of Mother Earth's hum<br>
