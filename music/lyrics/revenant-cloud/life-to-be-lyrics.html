Low to free<br>
Trust involving honesty<br>
He stepped out of the<br>
Flight and freeze<br>
Only to find a stolen<br>
Life-to-be<br>
Holy whole deals<br>
One dollar left upon the<br>
love-shield<br>
He’s gone exchanging for some<br>
time to heal<br>
The sword had kept him on a<br> 
longer bleed to know<br>
<br>
Swollen feet<br>
Tripping on<br>
No longer, he<br>
Reflects out of the<br> 
Songs he’ll sing<br>
The stones he kicked out of a<br>
Life-to-be<br>
Only whole fields<br>
New taller grass in dawning<br>
Full-feels<br>
He’s buried only to come<br>
Out a tree<br>
The sun had kept him on a<br>
Longer gleam to know<br>
<br>
