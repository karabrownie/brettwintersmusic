Settle down, I’m right in front of me<br>
I’ll be regarding my own taxonomy<br>
With a cut to the chase<br>
I try to make my flower bloom<br>
I’m thinking most of the time, I want the time to happen soon<br>
<br>
Solid ground is right in front of me<br>
I’m gonna trust in my own autonomy<br>
Some of the angels leave a sign in the waiting room<br>
They’re saying most of the time, the time will come when it’s ready to<br>
<br>
Foreign in form, but some knowing in the core of me<br>
Is the sum of a life I can feel but I cannot see<br>
Come out of hiding, you holy<br>
I wanna bathe in you, solely<br>
<br>
Homeward bound, you’re right in front of me<br>
I’ll be discarding my own taxonomy<br>
And under all of the ways I try to make that flower bloom<br>
You’re saying most of the time, I’ll never know what it’s coming to<br>
<br>
Shaky ground has left me wondering<br>
Whether I’m gonna trust when I’m lowly stumbling<br>
Whether some of the lines that people tell me, are they really true?<br>
I’m thinking most of the time, the truth’ll come when it’s ready to<br>
<br>
Foreign in form, but some knowing in the core of me<br>
Is the sum of a life I can feel but I cannot see<br>
Come out of hiding, you holy<br>
I wanna bathe in you, solely<br>
<br>
