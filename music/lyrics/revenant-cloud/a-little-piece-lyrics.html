We stalled it for rain<br>
The clod in our minds winnowed<br>
And only for weeks<br>
full of harbored reprieve, it showed<br>
Turn the dial on our little piece<br>
When infernos scathe the path we know, love<br>
<br>
Feigning dawn, we're reeling low<br>
No paradise to steal away<br>
Running far won't sate the flume, though<br>
And in time we're whole alone<br>
We're free to fall and we're free to lay<br>
Running far to make our way home<br>
<br>
