Don’t wait for my grace<br>
For you to find your own way through in time<br>
Our way home<br>
We paved for future’s latent flares to plume the sky<br>
<br>
We didn’t null the fire<br>
We didn’t know the light inside our own<br>
Luminous heart in a storm<br>
Oh, harbored your will in the bones<br>
Don’t know what it’ll take<br>
But know it’ll take us home<br>
<br>
Some days, no<br>
All days<br>
Your face appears inside my wooden mind<br>
I pray for your own grace<br>
For your heart-earned trials to turn some rain to shine<br>
<br>
We didn’t null the fire<br>
We just don’t know the light inside our own<br>
Luminous heart in a storm<br>
Oh, harbored your will in the bones<br>
Don’t know what it’ll take<br>
But know it’ll take us home<br>
<br>
