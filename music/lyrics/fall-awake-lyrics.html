If I don’t know<br>
Then I wonder till I know<br>
My jagged dome<br>
Caved in wait<br>
<br>
I've gone astray<br>
Not all my futures passed<br>
will see the light of day<br>
<br>
Fall awake<br>
Fall awake<br>
I see your face<br>
In everyone I’ll never know<br>
<br>
Canon cope<br>
I'm drawn to all I've ever known<br>
Like some old joke<br>
I never made<br>
<br>
The star's array<br>
Paints over the lines I thought<br>
I once would come to say<br>
<br>
Fall awake<br>
Fall awake<br>
I see your face<br>
In everyone I’ll never know<br>
<br>
