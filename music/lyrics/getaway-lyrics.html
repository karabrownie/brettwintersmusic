Summer was solving all my dull and lonely days<br>
My lonely days<br>
When I thought someone would stick it out and make a getaway<br>
Vulnerable souls in earthen pots all made of clay<br>
All made of clay<br>
When the one that shatters first can make or break<br>
A getaway<br>
<br>
Mmm…<br>
<br>
Somewhere she’s holding all her thawing palisades<br>
Her palisades<br>
When the faucet turns her heart into a lake<br>
She’s gonna bathe<br>
Foreign as gold in autumn’s lukewarm colored rays<br>
The colored rays<br>
When she holds onto the feelings, they all make<br>
A getaway<br>
<br>
Mmm…<br>
<br>
I wonder why all good stories have their struggle page<br>
The struggle page<br>
When the flames are what we breach, not what we brave<br>
We run away<br>
Leave it to love to soften someone’s hardened gaze <br>
Their hardened gaze <br>
When I look into her eyes, I find a place<br>
To overstay<br>
When I thought someone would stick it out and make<br>
A getaway<br>
<br>
Mmm...<br>
