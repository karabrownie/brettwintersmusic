(Fading light, it’s all insane<br>
I can hardly feel my pain)<br>
<br>
Fading light<br>
You’re all insane<br>
Chasing highs you’ll never come to know<br>
Run at me, run at me, run at me, slow<br>
Scream at me, scream at me, scream at me, no<br>
Desperate tries to out-desperate me<br>
<br>
Oh, look what you did to me<br>
Your head, a goddamn rogue<br>
Why? You’re a fucking tragedy<br>
<br>
Fading light<br>
I'm all insane<br>
Void his call and throw him in the wood<br>
Oh, runaway runaway runaway, slow<br>
Running down, running down, running down,<br>
Go<br>
Cowardly vows to have no fear<br>
<br>
Oh, look what you did to me<br>
Your headspace gone goddamn rogue<br>
Why? You’re a fucking tragedy<br>
