Sigh<br>
feel inside<br>
feel to find<br>
what tries to hide<br>
<br>
See?<br>
you're still here.<br>
your thoughts are clear<br>
you have no fear.<br>
<br>
Breathe deep<br>
you're not alone<br>
Breathe deep<br>
you're not alone<br>
<br>
Sigh<br>
feel inside<br>
feel to find<br>
the guilt abides<br>
No,<br>
that can't be true<br>
he took his leave<br>
what could you do?<br>
<br>
Breathe deep<br>
you're not at fault<br>
Breathe deep<br>
you're not at fault<br>
(Trying to trying to find anything<br>
to hold onto)<br>
(I can't I can't find anything<br>
to hold onto)<br>
(Life is but a dream)<br>
