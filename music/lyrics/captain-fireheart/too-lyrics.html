And the wind<br>
Nips at my heels<br>
Burn the coals<br>
The stranger’s here<br>
Waiting to shake my hand<br>
And pull, pull me down<br>
To the empty place I go<br>
<br>
What’s the use<br>
In wasting my space<br>
And biding time<br>
Life loses track<br>
He isn’t coming back<br>
In clairvoyant eyes<br>
The truth’s too hard to bear<br>
<br>
In that place<br>
Where the cut is deep<br>
Not a space<br>
To turn the head away<br>
So that is fate<br>
Well it’s too damn tall<br>
To feel is to fall<br>
Life, you two-faced bastard<br>
Allay all<br>
<br>
In the cave<br>
Repression, my friend<br>
Silent way<br>
Find the note<br>
You wrote on your battered lonely wall:<br>
“Feel the fire<br>
Or don’t feel at all”<br>
<br>
Plato’s flames<br>
Are on the stones<br>
Not a space<br>
To turn the head away<br>
So that is fate<br>
Well it’s too damn tall<br>
To feel is to fall<br>
Life, you two-faced bastard<br>
Allay all<br>
<br>
