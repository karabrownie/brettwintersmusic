As the sun sets and the world grows cold<br>
So do my hands<br>
No blame, no hope, nobody near<br>
No one to share<br>
<br>
And the silence it grows<br>
While you rest with a rose<br>
Oh, why do I play<br>
You can’t hear what I say<br>
<br>
Looks like my fire burned out now<br>
Promethean dreams ran aground<br>
Love makes its way to the heart<br>
Where emotional walls fall apart<br>
In their final plea to stand<br>
<br>
I know “sorry” won’t do<br>
But it's time to make do<br>
Oh why do I play<br>
You can’t hear what I say<br>
You can't hear what I say<br>
<br>
