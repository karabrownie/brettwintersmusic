Burning far, burning fast<br>
I’m the pitch in the wood, try’na make me last<br>
O, tinder and kindling Gods<br>
Share one more spark ‘fore my inspiration drops<br>
Tetris logs, feel my heat<br>
'Cause the one and only person that can light me up is me<br>
<br>
Torch the torch<br>
I’m here to explore<br>
All the heart my hands held before<br>
Burn the trails and<br>
ache for something more<br>
But no medication for the long haul<br>
I’d rather feel pain than nothing at all<br>
<br>
Burning soft, burning close<br>
I’m the pitch in the wood, tryna make the most<br>
of tinder and kindling piles<br>
'Cause there ain’t another gas station for one hundred miles<br>
Some rusted traffic signs<br>
Telling small town folks to stay inside the lines<br>
<br>
Torch the torch<br>
I’m here to explore<br>
Here be dragons, traces of a war<br>
Burn the trails<br>
I ache for something more<br>
<br>
But the pitch in the wood lets rise and fall<br>
Like a ten-year tower yields to a wrecking ball<br>
no medication for the long haul<br>
I’d rather feel pain than nothing at all<br>
