I heard it in the histrionica<br>
A narcissistic melodramatica<br>
All the little boys and girls love themselves<br>
A little too much<br>
A little too much<br>
<br>
It says so in the lexiconica<br>
That humans will implode fantastica<br>
Give it a few more years before<br>
The sticks and stones<br>
Turn to flying drones<br>
<br>
"Look inside<br>
To see what’s reflected on the outside"<br>
I don’t like the inside<br>
Let’s go outside<br>
Occupy<br>
All your precious minutes with my time<br>
So I don’t have to look me in the eye<br>
Let’s go outside<br>
And play with shiny things<br>
Let’s find some guy<br>
To tell us what the future brings<br>
<br>
I heard it in the histrionica<br>
A conformist non-conformist replica<br>
All the little boys and girls are test tubes<br>
Of programming code<br>
For their tell and show<br>
<br>
It says so in the lexiconica<br>
That the secrets are beyond scholastica<br>
But the armchair shines with dollar signs<br>
Eat the bait-and-switch<br>
and puke the gnosis pitch<br>
<br>
"Look inside<br>
To see what’s reflected on the outside"<br>
I don’t like the inside<br>
Let’s go outside<br>
Occupy<br>
All your precious minutes with my time<br>
So I don’t have to look me in the eye<br>
Let’s go outside<br>
And play with shiny things<br>
Let’s find some guy<br>
To tell us what the future brings<br>
