Toboggan Tom<br>
Amidst the winter now<br>
The world’s on his shoulders while dragging those snowballs uphill<br>
<br>
Toboggan Tom<br>
He’s like an atom bomb<br>
Ticking the days midst the haze that he finds himself in<br>
<br>
The polar scare<br>
Clawing his way from here to there<br>
Striking a match but not a flare<br>
Freezing his spine till his heart has gone blind<br>
But Tom can’t leave toboggan behind<br>
<br>
Toboggan Tom<br>
Wearing his feather down<br>
Yet feeling so heavy in snow that’s not ready to melt<br>
<br>
Toboggan Tom<br>
Hearing the distant sound<br>
Of murmuring voices from choices he wished he could make<br>
<br>
The polar scare<br>
Clawing his way from here to there<br>
Striking a match but not a flare<br>
Freezing his spine till his heart has gone blind<br>
But Tom can’t leave toboggan behind<br>
Tom can't leave toboggan behind...<br>
<br>
The truth or dare<br>
Showing the way from here to there<br>
Striking a match but not a flare<br>
Twisting his spine till his dreams won’t unwind<br>
But Tom can’t leave toboggan behind<br>
