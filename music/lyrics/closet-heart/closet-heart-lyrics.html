Mold and mildew coat the edge of the paint-cracked windowpane<br>
of a half-vacant apartment amidst the phone poles and parking lots<br>
He holds the scent of a thousand-year-old Cuban spray-on cologne<br>
Attracting ancient girls and their ancient emotional ways<br>
He always invites them to stay<br>
<br>
Open wide, his front door<br>
For such a closet heart<br>
For such a closet heart<br>
Secrets under his floor<br>
They have no mercy to part<br>
They have no mercy to part<br>
<br>
The lost and lonely lady friend finds her way back into his embrace<br>
Another thousand years of holographic surprise for their wonderful lives<br>
They watch the steam from another lifeless fling lift its way to the vent<br>
Where it turns into drinking water for some old poor soul in Spain<br>
Who also has a paint-cracked windowpane<br>
<br>
Open wide, his front door<br>
For such a closet heart<br>
For such a closet heart<br>
Secrets under his floor<br>
They have no mercy to part<br>
They have no mercy to part<br>
