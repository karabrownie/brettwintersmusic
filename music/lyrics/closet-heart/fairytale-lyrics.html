I look at my hands to remind myself<br>
Of a beautiful fairytale thought in a fairytale world<br>
And all of the magic that holds it in place<br>
Remains a mystery<br>
A mystery in the sparks<br>
<br>
I look at those fields growing crops so tall<br>
Raising fairytale children in fairytale soil<br>
The silent setting sun wishes them a goodnight<br>
And our cars tuck them in<br>
Tuck them in with dust<br>
<br>
We're floating on our magic carpet<br>
Through our beautiful fairytale world<br>
Rapunzel had her haircut in the sky<br>
The big bad wolf has come to say goodbye<br>
And the hum<br>
The hum of the engine is our reply<br>
<br>
I feel like I've lived this moment before<br>
This beautiful fairytale moment in a fairytale world<br>
Rolling down the iron rails retracing my path<br>
Or maybe just circling there <br>
Circling there and back<br>
<br>
We're floating on our magic carpet<br>
Through our beautiful fairytale world<br>
Rapunzel had her haircut in the sky<br>
The big bad wolf has come to say goodbye<br>
And the hum<br>
The hum of the engine is our reply<br>
<br>
We're floating on our magic carpet<br>
Through our beautiful fairytale world<br>
And all those hands and hills and precious moments<br>
Are magic tricks<br>
A mystery in the sparks<br>
<br>
Rapunzel had her haircut in the sky<br>
And the big bad wolf has come to say goodbye<br>
And the hum<br>
The hum of the engine is our reply<br>
