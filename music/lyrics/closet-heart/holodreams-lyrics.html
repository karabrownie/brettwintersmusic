Street lamps take the place for light of day<br>
Seems these misty mountains are begging to stay<br>
Right in my way<br>
<br>
The never-ending calendar marks<br>
Signify all of my effort thus far<br>
To be productive and full<br>
<br>
Maybe another punch of the clock<br>
Will buy me more time to win over my heart<br>
<br>
Or maybe I will stay in holodreams<br>
Theyâ€™re like my dreams except they can play on a screen<br>
And I can play them for keeps<br>
<br>
I can stay inside my painted walls<br>
Watching my painted screen show painted shopping malls<br>
They're so archaic and dull<br>
<br>
Maybe another ad-lib fresh start<br>
Will buy me more time to win over my heart<br>
<br>
Maybe tonight is a night for the streetcar<br>
I just need more time to win over my heart<br>
