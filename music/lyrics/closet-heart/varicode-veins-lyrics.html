Head around the back<br>
I’ve got secrets to confide<br>
Though I try not to remind myself<br>
of all the times I spoke<br>
And you turned the other way<br>
There’s more important things today<br>
Than listening to me sing all about my varicode veins<br>
<br>
Now you’re heading back<br>
You’ve got secrets to confide<br>
What a wonderful disguise<br>
For all the pain you’re going through<br>
It’s all right to be so blue<br>
You’ve earned a space to come renew<br>
From the love-me-please life-in-need<br>
Buried in those varicode veins<br>
<br>
Find all the signs<br>
All the programs in those lines<br>
And the one you left behind<br>
Your heart’s protected by the vines<br>
Of the love-no-more close-the-door<br>
Bound inside those varicode veins<br>
<br>
Seems that life’s on track<br>
We’ve got no more place to hide<br>
All our secrets we confide<br>
And yet despite our trying game<br>
We always manage through the pain<br>
Like some warlike ball-and-chain<br>
From a century out at sea<br>
On a slave with varicode veins<br>
<br>
Mind all the signs<br>
All the thoughts you can’t unwind<br>
And the journey is defined<br>
By the heart that’s in the vines<br>
Of the love-no-more close-the-door<br>
Bound inside those varicode veins<br>
<br>
Shine, redesign<br>
All the pictures in your life<br>
And the faults you left behind<br>
Are faulting over-under lines<br>
Of the always free, heavenly<br>
Love inside those varicode veins<br>
<br>
