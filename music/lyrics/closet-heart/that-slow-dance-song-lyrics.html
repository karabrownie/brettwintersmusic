The night's grown young<br>
Bougie forks for everyone<br>
But everyone has left us here<br>
To dine with faith and all our fears<br>
Then let us slow dance on granite tile<br>
Our anxious hearts will take awhile<br>
You and me are wrapped in cellophane<br>
Taking care to trim the preordained<br>
<br>
The tines broke through<br>
Seems those forks were overused<br>
Their every bite to be the best<br>
Left us here at their behest<br>
So let us hold chairs and drink their wine<br>
Like couples do when they're out of lies<br>
You and me are dressed in pricey thoughts<br>
Of a future that was already bought<br>
<br>
The light's grown strong<br>
Daytime waves to everyone<br>
But everyone is sleeping still<br>
Wake-up time is unfulfilled<br>
But we can slow dance to the morning news<br>
The wisdom came, and then it grew<br>
Like two seedlings in a barren field<br>
Love is here to sow but ours to heal<br>
<br>
