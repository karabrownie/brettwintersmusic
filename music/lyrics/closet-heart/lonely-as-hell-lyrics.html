And there I lie<br>
Sleeping on the floor at night<br>
Silence likes piercing the heartache<br>
She’s staking her claim on some prime real estate<br>
<br>
And there I wake<br>
Lonely as hell, in need of an “o”<br>
Dust mites gone rogue in the bedroom<br>
Fighting for the past with the skin cell platoon<br>
<br>
There’s no room for someone to hold me<br>
The spot next to me is reserved<br>
For the screen of three wishes<br>
<br>
And the unlovable kid inside<br>
Is afraid of the love he can take<br>
Even masters can make mistakes<br>
Well, I’m not a master, but at least I’m a fool<br>
Exploring the chronoillogical cesspool<br>
While mining through bedrock of sadness<br>
Like a slap in the face<br>
That’s gone straight to the chest<br>
<br>
And so I find<br>
Nobody in my room tonight<br>
The floor feels like work on a Monday<br>
Welcome to life, just a batch of clichés<br>
<br>
And love is one<br>
To avoid like the plague from long long ago<br>
Like a mansion with four hundred butlers<br>
Or a haunted house of mirrors with no key to the lock<br>
<br>
Will I find someone to hold me<br>
Or will I become Crazy Cat Man<br>
With two dozen felines<br>
And scratch marks on my shoulders?<br>
<br>
Keep a light on and reframe the fate<br>
Even masters can make mistakes<br>
Well, I’m not a master, but at least I’m a fool<br>
Exploring the chronoillogical cesspool<br>
While filming my cats pulling leg hairs<br>
Seems the moral of the story is who really cares?<br>
<br>
I'll just keep a light on<br>
Keep a light on<br>
Just keep a light on...<br>
Just keep a light, keep a light, keep a light...<br>
