Funny how it is<br>
Record our grievances inside<br>
Persephone, we're calling<br>
In love, in love, in love you hide<br>
<br>
Trails of leaflets turned<br>
Our minds won't resign<br>
Ceiling made of glass<br>
Iconoclasp<br>
Drenched our clothes dry<br>
<br>
We will always be fish in water<br>
Inside our lofty bowls<br>
We fear what's inside our<br>
Heart of hearts made of stone<br>
<br>
Money, now it is<br>
Excuse the fears we have inside<br>
Imaginary burdens<br>
In love, in love, in love they hide<br>
<br>
Countercept the voice<br>
That tells us "no"<br>
Or grind the heels<br>
With even keel<br>
Nowhere, then, to go<br>
<br>
We will always be fish in water<br>
Inside our lofty bowls<br>
We fear what's inside our<br>
Heart of hearts made of stone<br>
<br>
We will always be storm in calm lands<br>
Resistance is our silo<br>
Drown out the stillness<br>
In a downpour of woe<br>
<br>
