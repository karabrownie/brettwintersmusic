Leviathan in the hall<br>
Came out of the dungeon<br>
Looking for victims<br>
Pressure for the weak and strong<br>
We drop our books and draw the swords<br>
To red-vein yellow-stained eyes<br>
Always be starving, never be hungry<br>
Targeting the one who cries<br>
He takes a bite to feed the fear inside us<br>
<br>
Lies for us<br>
Ziggy the troll is on a roll<br>
He's slipping on the old saliva throne<br>
Depose pose<br>
Breaking tile just to be known<br>
But how long?<br>
How long?<br>
For how long?<br>
How long?<br>
<br>
A hunch-back wiry frame<br>
Looking to brave the defensible monster<br>
Armors for the toxic shame<br>
He takes the word and drops his name<br>
For something he canâ€™t recall<br>
Expletive this or inadequate that<br>
The newly anointed thrall<br>
Runs through the hallways feeding fear inside us<br>
<br>
Lies for us<br>
Ziggy the troll is on a roll<br>
He's slipping on the old saliva throne<br>
Depose pose<br>
Breaking tile just to be known<br>
For how long?<br>
How long?<br>
How long?<br>
How long?<br>
