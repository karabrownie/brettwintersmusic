Gerry Mandarin<br>
Wringing all the life from the life he has been<br>
Is there something troubling?<br>
No, just another thought of a future that is flooding, though.<br>
He's washing the blue jean days...<br>
<br>
Running fast, running slow, time to stop, time to go<br>
He don’t wanna go down to the down down below<br>
Running fast, running slow, time to stop -<br>
He’s gonna hit<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top, oh<br>
<br>
Gerry Mandarin<br>
Owns up to the weights of the nights he has been<br>
Biases and Gods<br>
Are leaving all their things ‘cause their done leading him, oh<br>
He's washing the truth with malaise...<br>
<br>
Running fast, running slow, time to stop, time to go<br>
He don’t wanna go down to the down down below<br>
Running fast, running slow, time to stop -<br>
He’s gonna hit<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top, oh<br>
<br>
Twenty, twenty times, twenty times<br>
To fall down on his broken knees<br>
Twenty, twenty times, twenty times<br>
To fall down on his broken knees<br>
<br>
Running fast, running slow, time to stop, time to go<br>
He don’t wanna go down to the down down below<br>
Running fast, running slow, time to stop -<br>
He’s gonna hit<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top<br>
Twenty rock bottoms on the way to the top<br>
Twenty rock bottoms, twenty rock bottoms, oh<br>
<br>
Twenty, twenty times, twenty times<br>
To fall down on his broken knees<br>
Twenty, twenty times, twenty times<br>
To fall down on his broken knees<br>
