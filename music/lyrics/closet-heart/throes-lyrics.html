We came from wounded<br>
Birds in the nighttime<br>
They broke our wings as<br>
Ones did before them<br>
<br>
We fly unsteady<br>
Wonder what is missing<br>
Cored all our anger<br>
In rings of the tree<br>
Carefully<br>
Treading lightly<br>
<br>
We came from wounded<br>
Birds in the unknown<br>
No map for their kind<br>
Vines overgrown<br>
<br>
Cartographers, we<br>
Map all their ruins<br>
Building on soft stone<br>
Tracks for our freight trains<br>
Two lanes:<br>
Sane or insane<br>
<br>
Soon<br>
We’ll come to know<br>
Silence<br>
Soon<br>
We’ll feel the throes<br>
Trying, fighting<br>
Hiding, pining<br>
<br>
