You wanted fields as far as the eyes could see<br>
And mountains with gold peaks<br>
Moving 'long some long-worn broken rails<br>
While you sit right next to me<br>
all the while you’d be sitting next to me<br>
<br>
City stars and greener grass, it seems<br>
Had a greener grip on me<br>
You can love my photos on your screen<br>
So you don’t have to love me<br>
Love the photos and you don’t have to love me<br>
<br>
I ran away through summer storms<br>
My mistake, I’m misinformed<br>
I found my ticket<br>
buried underneath a pile of borrowed patience<br>
But by the time I came on back<br>
your train had left the station<br>
oh, your train had left the station<br>
<br>
You wanted time, oh time, no guarantees<br>
Here, no one plays for keeps<br>
When the hand you hold is one I fold<br>
You’d better stay away from me<br>
You’re better off to stay away from me<br>
<br>
I ran away through summer storms<br>
My mistake, I'm misinformed<br>
I found my ticket<br>
buried underneath a pile of borrowed patience<br>
But by the time I came on back<br>
your train had left the station<br>
oh, your train had left the station<br>
<br>
(We live on<br>
Different stars<br>
One too close<br>
One too far)<br>
<br>
I ran away through summer storms<br>
My mistake, love misinformed<br>
When the silence<br>
Of our ending has surpassed all consolation<br>
When the iron rails have bent on back<br>
Your train will leave the station<br>
<br>
Your train has left the station.<br>
