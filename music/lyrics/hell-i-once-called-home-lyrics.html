I take a train from the hell I once called home<br>
I take a train from the hell I once called home<br>
I hope to find a place on the roam<br>
Where the judge won’t have her way<br>
And the fairgrounds light the bay<br>
And the troubles of my past have gone to lay<br>
<br>
I left my folks in the pleading mist of morn<br>
I left my folks in the pleading mist of morn<br>
They blend their tears out in the storm<br>
And their coattails ride the haze<br>
Of a misty lifeboat gray<br>
Where the waves of time break through their humdrum days<br>
<br>
I told my friend he was the only good I saw<br>
I told my friend he was the only good I saw<br>
'Cause in my head there’s a break in the law<br>
Where the outlaws run the place<br>
And my history invades<br>
And the angels fly right past my shoulder blades<br>
<br>
I take a train from the hell I once called home<br>
I take a train from the hell I once called home<br>
I hope to find a place on the roam<br>
Where the judge won’t have her way<br>
And the fairgrounds light the bay<br>
And the troubles of my past have gone to lay<br>
But the hell I once called home is calling today<br>
